so u had a week of coding experience,
what is the toughest hurdle actually in ur mind?

the flow

we know how it works, our brain can do the flow, but how can i tell the computer to perform the same?

i give u an example
u guys did roman exercise before

5000 - MMMM
4 -IV instead of IIII

what did my brain actually do?

learn math before  when we look at 5000, we know its 5 M, so these two weeks of coding challenges actually exercise our brain to think like a computer which we nvr learn / practice before, when sth new is introduced to our brain, we feel struggle. everybody agrees?


so u know? i think the hint is this: when our brain thinks of 1 step, it might be already a few steps...
when i know 5400 is actually MMMMCCCC
what it does is


i know there is 5 M because i did this: 5000 is inside, i did




1)5000/ 1000 = 5

this is first small little step in my brain

2) i ignore the first 5000 now, i focus on 400 now,
again my brain does this: 400/100 = 4

so the whole trick of first 2/ few weeks of coding, i m actually training my brains to do these:



1) when an error appears on terminal, i so hope i know what it means... and it tells me my next step.
now, u should have seen this more than ur friend..
A) syntax error --- lack of end? didnt close it properly? or some misspace? maybe some extra end? how can i do to help to reduce this syntax error frequency?

one of the things that can help i think.. is INDENTATION, with proper indentation habit

it allows me to close stuff properly, less errors, quicker coding, more time to debug

B) unknown method/ variable error?
wrong method name
maybe we didnt define it before call it?
or its being defined somewhere but its not accessible in another method...

C) stack level too deep
the loop is so deep, because it doesnt flow until it converges into an exit condition


don't worry if u think ur struggling, its absolutely normal, we always said coding is like SFT (struggle, frustration and tears)
